            <h4>Adaptations:</h4>
            <ul>
                <h5>
                    Wontons 
                </h5>
                <li>If you are looking to make this soup a little richer, and heartier. I would highly recommend adding some frozen wontons or dumplings. Just add them in after you stir in the miso, and cook until they are cooked all the way through.  </li>
                <h5>
                    Egg 
                </h5>
                <li>If you want to create a miso soup egg drop soup corssover, I highly recommend wisking an egg or two the the boiling soup to make this soup even more delish and filling  </li>
                <h5>
                   Soba or Ramen Noodles  
                </h5>
                <li>Adding a soba or ramen noodle to the soup makes it that more delish. Just cook the noodle according to the instructions and  stir in right before you are about to serve </li>
                <h5> Spinach, Kale
                </h5>
                <li>Adding a hearty leafy green (great compliment to the egg) is a great idea. It can be whatever leftover greens you have in fridge that you need/ want to use up!
                </li>
