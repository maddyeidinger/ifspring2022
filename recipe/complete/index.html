            Maddy's Miso Soup 
        </p>

        <p class="preface">
            I love soup. And I like cooking a moderate amount. But after a long day of classes, Iâ€™m tried and I'm hungry. And all I want is a hot bowl of warm soup. ASAP. So I turned to miso soup.nIt has become a staple in my routine and my life. Its verstile, its healthy, its delicious and truly a recipe you will never get bored of! Without further adieu, here is my adapted Miso Soup recipe!

                <h2>
                    wontons 
                </h2>

                <p>If you are looking to make this soup a little richer, and heartier. I would highly recommend adding some frozen wontons or dumplings. Just add them in after you stir in the miso, and cook until they are cooked all the way through.  
                <p>

                <h2>
                    egg 
                </h2>
                <p>If you want to create a miso soup egg drop soup corssover, I highly recommend wisking an egg or two the the boiling soup to make this soup even more delish and filling  </p>

                <h2>
                   soba or ramen noodles  
                </h2>
                <p>Adding a soba or ramen noodle to the soup makes it that more delish. Just cook the noodle according to the instructions and  stir in right before you are about to serve </p>
                
                <h2> spinach, kale
                </h2>
                <p>Adding a hearty leafy green (great compliment to the egg) is a great idea. It can be whatever leftover greens you have in fridge that you need/ want to use up!
