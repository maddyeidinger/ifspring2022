        <p>4. I would love to learn how to make a super cool and interactive website </p>
        <p>5. When you are designing for a screen, you have the opportunity to be way more creative and engage your audience in a different way </p>
        <p>6. A website I really like is 
            <a href="https://skims.com"> SKIMS </a>
             which is Kim Kardasians clothing line, and I enjoy the website because it is easy to navigate, aestically pleasing and well organized </p>
        <p>7. A website that effectively communicates its contents is 
            <a href="https://www.wsj.com"> The Wall Street Journal</a>
            because it displays the relevant news in a way that allows you to easily skim over different stories quickly and efficently, without it feeling overwhelming

            8. A website that works well is
